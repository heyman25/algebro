A car manufacturer claims that the front tyres on a particular model
of car have an average life span of 20 000 miles. Following comments
from customers, the sales manager wishes to test if the life span
of the tyres is greater than 20000 miles. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain why the sales manager should carry out a l-tail test. State
hypotheses for the test defining any symbols you use. \hfill{} {[}3{]}
\end{enumerate}
The sales manager contacts customers and gathers details about the
life spans of a random sample of 50 of these tyres. The life spans,
$x$ thousand miles, are summarised below.
\[
\sum\left(x-20\right)=9.4\,\sum\left(x-20\right)^{2}=38.76.
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(b)]  Calculate unbiased estimates of the population mean and variance
of the life spans of the tyres. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item[(c)] Test, at the 5\% level of significance, whether the mean life span
of front tyres is more than 20000 miles. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item[(d)] Explain why this test would be inappropriate if the sales manager
had taken a random sample of 15 tyres. \hfill{} {[}1{]}
\end{enumerate}
