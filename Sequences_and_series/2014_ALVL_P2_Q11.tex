An art dealer sells both original paintings and prints. (Prints are
copies of paintings.) It is to be assumed that his sales of originals
per week can be modelled by the distribution $Po\left(2\right)$ and
his sales of prints per week can be modelled by the independent distribution
$Po\left(11\right)$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that, in a randomly chosen week, 
\begin{enumerate}
\item the an dealer sells more than 8 prints,\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item the art dealer sells a total of fewer than 15 prints and originals
combined. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
\item The probability that the art dealer sells fewer than 3 originals in
a period of $n$ weeks is less than 0.01. Express this information
as an inequality in $n$, and hence find the smallest possible integer
value of $n$.\hfill{} {[}5{]}
\item Using a suitable approximatioa, which should be stated. find the probability
that the art dealer sells more than 550 prints in a year (52 weeks).\hfill{}

\item Give two reasons in context why the assumptions made at the start
of this question may not be valid. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
