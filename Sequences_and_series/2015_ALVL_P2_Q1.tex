As a tree grows, the rate of increase of its height, $h$ m, with
respect to time, $t$ years after planting, is modelled by the differential
equation 
\[
\frac{dh}{dt}=\frac{1}{10}\sqrt{16-\frac{1}{2}h}.
\]
The tree is planted as a seedling of negligible height, so that $h=0$
when $t=0$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item State the maximum height of the tree, according to this model. \hfill{}
{[}1{]}
\item Find an expression for $t$ in terms of $h$, and hence find the time
the tree takes to reach half its maximum height. \hfill{}{[}5{]}
\end{enumerate}
