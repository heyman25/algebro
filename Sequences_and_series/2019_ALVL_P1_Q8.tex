\begin{enumerate}
\item An arithmetic series has first term $a$ and common difference $2a$,
where $a\neq0$. A geometric series has first term $a$ and common
ratio $2$. The $k$th term of the geometric series is equal to the
sum of the first 64 terms of the arithmetic selies. Find the value
of $k$.\hfill{} {[}3{]}
\item A geometric series has first term $f$ and common ratio $r$, where
$f$, $r\in\mathbb{R}$ and $f\neq0$. The sum of the first four terms
of the series is 0. Find the possible values of $f$ and $r$. Find
also, in terms of $f$, the possible values of the sum of the first
$n$ terms of the series. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item The first term of an arithmetic series is negative. The sum of the
first four terms of the series is 14 and the product of the first
four terms of the series is 0. Find the 11th term of the series. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
