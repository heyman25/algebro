The average number of errors per page for a certain daily newspaper
is being investigated. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item State, in context, two assumptions that need to be made for the number
of errors per page to be well modelled by a Poisson distribution.
\hfill{}{[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
Assume that the number of errors per page has the distribution $Po\left(1.3\right)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that, on one day, there are more than 10 errors
altogether on the first 6 pages. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item The probability that there are fewer than 2 errors altogether on the
first n pages of the newspaper is less than 0.05. Write down an inequality
in terms of $n$ to represent this information, and hence find the
least possible value of $n$. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
