It is given that $f\left(x\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{9-x^{2}}}$, where
$-3<x<3$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write down $\int f\left(x\right)\,dx$.\hfill{} {[}1{]}
\item Find the binomial expansion for $f\left(x\right)$, up to and including
the term in $x^{6}$. Give the coefficients as exact fractions in
their simplest form.\hfill{} {[}4{]}
\item Hence, or otherwise, find the first four non-zero terms of the Maclaun'n
series for $\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{3}x\right)$. Give the coefficients
as exact fractions in their simplest form.\hfill{} {[}4{]}
\end{enumerate}
