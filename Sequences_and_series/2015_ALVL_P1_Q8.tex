Two athletes are to run 20 km by running 50 laps around a circular
track of length 400 m. They aim to complete the distance in between
$1\frac{1}{2}$ hours and $1\frac{3}{4}$ hours inclusive.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Athlete $A$ was the first lap in $T$ seconds and each subsequent
lap takes 2 seconds longer than the previous lap. Find the set of
values of $T$ which will enable $A$ to complete the distance within
the . required time interval. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item Athlete B runs the first lap in $t$ seconds and the time for each
subsequent lap is 2\% more than the time for the previous lap. Find
the set of values of $t$ which will enable B to complete the distance
within the required time interval.\hfill{} {[}4{]}
\item Assuming each athlete completes the 20 km run in exactly $1\frac{1}{2}$
hours, find the difference in the athletes\textquoteleft{} times for
their 50th laps, giving your answer to the nearest second. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\end{enumerate}
