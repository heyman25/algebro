Gold coins are found scattered throughout an archaeological site. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item State two conditions needed for the number of gold coins found in
a randomly chosen region of area 1 square metre to be well modelled
by a Poisson distribution. {[}2{]} 
\end{enumerate}
Assume that the number of gold coins in l square metre has the distribution
$Po\left(0.8\right)$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that in 1 square metre there are at least 3 gold
coins. {[}1{]} 
\item It is given that the probability that 1 gold coin is found in $x$
square metres is 0.2. Write down an equation for $x$, and solve it
numerically given that $x<1$. {[}2{]} 
\item Use a suitable approximation to find the probability that in 100 square
metres there are at least 90 gold coins. State the parameter(s) of
the distribution that you use. {[}3{]} 
\end{enumerate}
Pottery shards are also found scattered throughout the site. The number
of pottery shards in l square metre is an independent random variable
with the distribution $Po\left(3\right)$. Use suitable approximations,
whose parameters should be stated, to find 
\begin{enumerate}
\item the probability that in 50 square metres the total number of gold
coins and pottery shards is at least 200, {[}4{]} 
\item the probability that in 50 square metres there are at least 3 times
as many pottery shards as gold coins. {[}3{]}
\end{enumerate}
