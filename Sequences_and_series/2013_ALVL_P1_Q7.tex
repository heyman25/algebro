A gardener is cutting off pieces of string from a long roll of string.
The first piece he cuts off is 128 cm long and each successive piece
is $\frac{2}{3}$ as long as the preceding piece. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The length of the $n$th piece of string cut off is $p$ cm. Show
that 
\[
\ln p=\left(An+B\right)\ln2+(Cn+D)\ln3,
\]
for constants $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ to be determined. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item Show that the total length of string cut off can never be greater
than 384 cm. \hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item How many pieces must be cut off before the total length cut off is
greater than 380cm? You must show sufficient working to justify your
answer. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\end{enumerate}
