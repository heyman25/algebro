On a remote island a zoologist measures the tail lengths of a random
sample of 20 squirrels. In a species of squirrel known to her. the
tail lengths have mean 14.0 cm. She carries out a test. at the 5\%
significance level, of whether squirrels on the island have the same
mean tail length as the species known to her. She assumes that the
tail lengths of squirrels on the island are normally distributed with
standard deviation 3.8 cm. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item State appropriate hypotheses for the test. {[}1{]}
\end{enumerate}
The sample mean tail length is denoted by $\overline{x}$ cm.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use an algebraic method to calculate the set of values of $\overline{x}$
for which the null hypothesis would not be rejected. (Answers obtained
by trial and improvement from a calculator will obtain no marks.)
{[}3{]}
\item State the conclusion of the test in the case where $\overline{x}=15.8$.
