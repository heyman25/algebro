The production manager of a food manufacturing company wishes to take
a random sample of a certain type of biscuit bar front the thousands
produced one day at his factory. for quality control purposes. He
wishes to check that the mean mass of the bars is 32 grams. as stated
on the packets. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item State what it means for a sample to be random in this context. \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\end{enumerate}
The masses, $x$ grams, of a random sample of 40 biscuit bars are
summarised as follows. 
\[
n=40\,\,\sum\left(x-32\right)=-7.7\,\,\sum\left(x-32\right)^{2}=11.05
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate unbiased estimates of the population mean and variance of
the mass of biscuit bars. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item Test, at the 1\% level of significance, the claim that the mean mass
of biscuit bars is 32 grams. You should state your hypotheses and
define any symbols you use.\hfill{} {[}5{]}
\item Explain why there is no need for the production manager to know anything
about the population distribution of the masses of the biscuit bars.
