Fig. 1 shows a piece of card, $ABC$, in the form of an equilateral
triangle of side $a$. A kite shape is cut from each corner. to give
the shape shown in Fig. 2. The remaining card shown in Fig. 2 is folded
along the dotted lines, to form the open triangular prism of height
$x$ shown in Fig. 3.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that the volume $V$ of the prism is given by $V=\frac{1}{4}x\sqrt{3}\left(a-2x\sqrt{3}\right)^{2}$.
\hfill{} {[}3{]}
\item Use differentiation to find, in terms of $a$, the maximum value of
$V$, proving that it is a maximum. \hfill{}{[}6{]}
\end{enumerate}
