\item {[}ALVL/2015/P1/6{]}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write down the first three non-zero terms in the Maclaurin series
for $\ln\left(1+2x\right)$, where $-\frac{1}{2}<x\leq\frac{1}{2}$,
simplifying the coefficients.\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item It is given that the three terms found in part (i) are equal to the
first three terms in the series expansion of $ax\left(1+bx\right)^{c}$
for small $x$. Find the exact values of the constants $a$, $b$
and $c$ and use these values to find the coefficient of $x^{4}$
in the expansion of $ax\left(1+bx\right)^{c}$, giving your answer
as a simplified rational number. \hfill{}{[}6{]}
