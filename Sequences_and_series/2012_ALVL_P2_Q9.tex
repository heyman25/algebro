In an opinion poll before an election. a sample of 30 voters is obtained. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The number of voters in the sample who support the Alliance Party
is denoted by $A$. State, in context, what must be assumed for $A$
to be well modelled by a binomial distribution. {[}2{]} 
\end{enumerate}
Assume now that $A$ has the distribution $B\left(30,p\right)$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given that $p=0.15$, find $P\left(A=3\,\text{or }4\right)$. {[}2{]} 
\item Given instead that $p=0.55$, explain whether it is possible to approximate
the distribution of $A$ with 
\begin{enumerate}
\item a normal distribution, 
\item a Poisson distribution. {[}3{]} 
\end{enumerate}
\item For an unknown value of $p$ it is given that $P\left(A=15\right)=0.06864$
correct to 5 decimal places. Show that $p$ satisfies an equation
of the form $p\left(1-p\right)=k$, where $k$ is a constant to be
determined. Hence find the value of $p$ to a suitable degree of accuracy,
given that $p<0.5$. {[}5{]}
\end{enumerate}
