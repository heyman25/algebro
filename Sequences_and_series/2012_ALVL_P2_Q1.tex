\item {[}ALVL/2012/P2/1{]}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the general solution of the differential equation 
\[
\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}=16-9x^{2},
\]
 giving your answer in the form $y=f\left(x\right)$. {[}3{]} 
\item Given that $u$ and $t$ are related by 
\[
\frac{du}{dt}=16-9u^{2},
\]

and that $u=1$ when $t=0$, find $t$ in terms of $u$, simplifying
your answer. {[}5{]}
