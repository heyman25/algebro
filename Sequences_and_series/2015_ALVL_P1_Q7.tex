Referred to the origin $O$, points $A$ and $B$ have position vectors
$\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ respectively. Point $C$ lies on $OA$,
between $O$ and $A$, such that $OC:CA=3:2$. Point $D$ lies on
$OB$, between $O$ and $B$, such that

$OD:DB=5:6$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the position vectors $\vec{OC}$ and $\vec{OD}$, givmg your
answers in terms of $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$.\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item Show that the vector equation of the line $BC$ can be written as
$\mathbf{r}=\frac{3}{5}\lambda\mathbf{a}+\left(1-\lambda\right)\mathbf{b}$,
where $\lambda$ is a parameter. Find in a similar form the vector
equation of the line $AD$ in terms of a parameter $\mu$. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item Find, in terms of $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$, the position vector
of the point $E$ where the lines $BC$ and $AD$ meet and find the
ratio $AE:ED$.\hfill{} {[}5{]}
