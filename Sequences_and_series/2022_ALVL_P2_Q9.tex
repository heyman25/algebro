A game is played using a counter on a board.
\begin{itemize}
\item The counter starts from a point S at the bottom of the board and moves
upwards (see diagram).
\item When leaving S the counter is equally likely to move up to the left
to junction L or up to the right to junction R.
\item At every junction after S, the counter moves up to the left with probability
$p$ or up to the right with probability $q$, where $p+q=1$ . 
\item The counter eventually arrives at one of the endpoints A, B, C, D,
E or F.

\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that the probability the counter arrives at B is $2p^{3}q+\frac{1}{2}p^{4}$.

\end{enumerate}
Jon and Kath each play this game, and their counters both arrive at
B. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(b)]   Find, in terms of $p$, a simplified fraction for the probability
that Jon's and Kath\textquoteleft s counters followed exactly the
same route.\hfill{} {[}4{]}
\end{enumerate}
The probability that a counter arrives at B is the same as the probability
that a counter arrives at C.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(c)]  Find the value of $p$.\hfill{}{[}4{]}
\end{enumerate}
