It is given that $y=f\left(x\right)$, where $f\left(x\right)=\tan\left(ax+b\right)$
for constants $a$ and $b$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $f'(x)=a+ay^{2}$. Use this result to find $f''\left(x\right)$
and $f'''\left(x\right)$ in terms of $a$ and $y$. \hfill{}{[}5{]}
\item In the case where $b=\text{\ensuremath{\frac{1}{4}\pi}}$, use your
results from part (i) to find the Maclaurin series for $f\left(x\right)$
in terms of $a$, up to and including the term in $x^{3}$. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item Find the first two non-zero terms in the Maclaurin series for $\tan2x$.
