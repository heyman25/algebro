A motoring magazine editor believes that the figures quoted by car
manufacturers for distances travelled per litre of fuel are too high.
He carries out a survey into this by asking for information from readers.
For a certain model of car, 8 readers reply with the following data,
measured in km per litre.
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccccccc}
14.0 & 12.5 & 11.0 & 11.0 & 12.5 & 12.6 & 15.6 & 13.2\tabularnewline
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate unbiased estimates of the population mean and variance.
\hfill{}{[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
The manufacturer claims that this model of car will travel 13.8 km
per litre on average. It is given that the distances travelled per
litre for cars of this model are normally distributed. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Stating a necessary assumption, carry out a $t$-test of the magazine
editor's belief at the 5\% significance level. \hfill{}{[}5{]}
