A stone is held on the surface of a pond and released. The stone falls
vertically through the water and the distance, $x$ metres, that the
stone has fallen in time $t$ seconds is measured. It is given that
$x=0$ and $\frac{dx}{dt}=0$ when $t=0$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The motion of the stone is modelled by the differential equation 
\[
\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+2\frac{dx}{dt}=10.
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item By substituting $y=\frac{dx}{dt}$, show that the differential equation
can be written as $\frac{dy}{dt}=10-2y$. \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\item Find $y$ in terms of $t$ and hence find $x$ in terms of $t$. \hfill{}{[}6{]}
\end{enumerate}
\item A second model for the motion of the stone is suggested, given by
the differential equation 
\[
\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}=10-5\sin\frac{1}{2}t.
\]
Find $x$ in terms of $t$ for this model. \hfill{} {[}3{]}
\item The pond is 5 metres deep. For each of these models, find the time
the stone takes to reach the bottom of the pond, giving your answers
correct to 2 decimal places. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
