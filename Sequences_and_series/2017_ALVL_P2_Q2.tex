A geometric progression has first term 3 and common ratio $r$. The
sum of the first 13 terms of the progression is 156.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $r^{13}-52r+51=0$. Show that the common ratio cannot be
1 even though $r=l$ is a root of this equation. Find the possible
values of the common ratio. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item It is given that the common ratio of the geometric progression is
positive. and that. the nth term of this geometric progression is
more than 100 times the $n$th term of the arithmetic progression.
Write down an inequality, and hence find the smallest possible value
of $n$. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
