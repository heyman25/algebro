Scientists are investigating the eifect of disease on the number of
sheep on a small island. They discover that every year the death rate
of the sheep is greater than the birth rate of the sheep. The difi\textquoteleft crcnce
every year between the death rate and the birth rate for the population
of sheep on the island is 3\%. The number of sheep on the island is
$P$ at a time $t$ years after the scientists begin observations. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write down a differential equation relating $P$ and $t$.\hfill{}
{[}2{]}
\item Solve this differential equation to find an expression for $P$ in
terms of $t$. Explain what happens to the number of sheep if this
situation continues over many years. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\end{enumerate}
The scientists import sheep at a constant unifomt rate of $n$ sheep
per year. (The difference every year between the death rate and the
birth rate remains at 3\%.)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write down a differential equation to model the new situation.\hfill{}

\item Solve the differential equation to find an expression for $P$ in
terms of $t$ and $n$. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item Given that the number of sheep settles down to 500 after many years,
find $n$. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
