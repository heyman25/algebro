The number of minutes that the 0815 has arrives late at my local bus
stop has a normal distribution; the mean number of minutes the bus
is late has been 4.3. A new company takes over the service, claiming
that punctuality will be improved. After the new company takes over,
a random sample of 10 days is taken and the number of minutes that
the bus is late is recorded. The sample mean is $\overline{t}$ minutes
and the sample variance is $k^{2}$ minutes$^{2}$. A test is to be
carried out at the 10\% level of significance to determine whether
the mean number of minutes late has been reduced. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item State appropriate hypotheses for the test, defining any symbols that
you use.\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item Given that $k^{2}=3.2$, find the set of values of $\overline{t}$
for which the result of the test would be that the null hypothesis
is not rejected.\hfill{} {[}4{]}
\item Given instead that $\overline{t}=4.0$. find the set of values of
$k^{2}$ for which the result of the test would be to reject the null
hypothesis.\hfill{} {[}3{]}
\end{enumerate}
