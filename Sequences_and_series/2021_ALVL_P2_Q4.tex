Mrs Wong is the president of a swimming club. She devises a training
programme for members of the club. Members swim 10 lengths of a swimming
pool: the time taken to swim the first length is 40 seconds and the
time taken to swim the last length is 25 seconds. The times taken
for each of the 10 lengths are in arithmetic progression.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the total time taken to swim 10 lengths using Mrs Wong's programme.
\hfill{}{[}2{]} 
\end{enumerate}
One of the members of the club, Alfie, devises a different training
programme. In Alfie\textquoteleft s programme the time taken to swim
the first length is 25 seconds and the time taken to swim the last
length is 40 seconds. The times taken for each of the 10 lengths are
in geometric progression. 

Suzie swims 30 lengths. She swims 10 lengths using Mrs Wong's programme,
then she swims 10 lengths taking 25 seconds for each length, and then
she swims 10 lengths using Alfie's programme.

The length of the pool is 35 m.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(b)]  Find Suzie's average speed for her swim of 30 lengths. \hfill{}{[}5{]}
\item[(c)]  Determine whether, exactly 8 minutes after she starts to swim, Suzie
is swimming away from or towards her starting point. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
