A sequence $u_{1},u_{2},u_{3},\dots$ is such that $u_{n+1}=2u_{n}+An$,
where $A$ is a constant and $n>1$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given that $u_{1}=5$ and $u_{2}=15$, find $A$ and $u_{3}$. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
It is known that the $n$th term of this sequence is given by 
\[
u_{n}=a\left(2^{n}\right)+bn+c,
\]
where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find $a$, $b$ and $c$.\hfill{} {[}4{]}
\item Find $\sum_{r=1}^{n}u_{r}$ in terms of $n$. (You need not simplify
your answer.) \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\end{enumerate}
