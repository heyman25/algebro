On average one in 20 packets of a breakfast cereal contains a free
gift. Jack buys $n$ packets from a supermarket. The number of these
packets containing a free gift is the random variable $F$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item State, in context, two assumptions needed for $F$ to be well modelled
by a binomial distribution. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
Assume now that $F$ has a binomial distribution. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given that $n=20$, find $P\left(F=1\right)$. \hfill{} {[}1{]}
\item Given instead that $n=60$, use a suitable approximation to find the
probability that $F$ is at least 5. State the parameter(s) of the
distribution that you use. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\end{enumerate}
