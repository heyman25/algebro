An arithmetic series has first term $a$ and common difference $d$,
where $a$ and $d$ are non-zero. A geometric series has first term
$b$ and common ratio $r$, where $b$ and $r$ are non-zero. It is
given that the 4th, 9th and 12th terms of the arithmetic series are
equal to the 5th, 8th and 15th terms of the geometric series respectively. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $r$ satisfies the equation $5r^{10}-8r^{3}+3=0$. Given
that $\left|r\right|<1$, solve this equation, giving your answer
correct to 2 decimal places. \hfill{} {[}4{]}
\item Using this value of $r$, find, in terms of $b$ and $n$, the sum
of the terms of the geometric series after, but not including, the
$n$th term, simplifying your answer. \hfill{} {[}3{]}
\end{enumerate}
