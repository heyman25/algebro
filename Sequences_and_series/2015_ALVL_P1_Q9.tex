\begin{enumerate}
\item The complex number $w$ is such that $w=a+ib$, where $a$ and $b$
are non-zero real numbers. The complex conjugate of $w$ is denoted
by $w^{\ast}$. Given that $\frac{w^{2}}{w^{\ast}}$ is purely imaginary,
find the possible vahies of $w$ in terms of $a$.\hfill{} {[}5{]}
\item The complex number $z$ is such that $z^{5}=-32i$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the modulus and argument of each of the possible values of $z$.\hfill{}
{[}4{]}
\item Two of these values are $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$, where $\frac{1}{2}\pi<\arg z_{1}<\pi$
and $-\pi<\arg z_{2}<-\frac{1}{2}\pi$. Find the exact value of $\arg\left(z_{1}-z_{2}\right)$
in terms of $\pi$ and show that $\left|z_{1}-z_{2}\right|=4\sin\left(\frac{1}{5}\pi\right)$.
