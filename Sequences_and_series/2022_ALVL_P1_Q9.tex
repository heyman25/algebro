\item An arithmetic series has first term $a$ and common difference $d$,
where $d\ne0$. The first, third and fifteenth terms of this series
are the first, second and third terms of a geometric series. Find
$d$ in terms of $a$.\hfill{} {[}3{]}
\item A geometric series has first term $\sin\theta$ and common ratio $-\cos\theta$,
where $0<\theta<\frac{\pi}{2}$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that the sum to infinity of this series is $\tan k\theta$, where
$k$ is a constant to be found. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item Given that $\theta=\frac{\pi}{3}$, find the exact sum of the first
seven terms of this series. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
