Water is poured at a rate of 0.1$\mathrm{m}^{3}$ per minute into
a container in the form of an open cone. The semi-vertical angle of
the cone is $\alpha$, where $\tan\alpha=0.5$. At time $t$ minutes
after the start, the radius of the water surface is $r$ m (see diagram).
Find the rate of increase of the depth of water when the volume of
water in the container is 3$\mathrm{m}^{3}$. \hfill{} {[}7{]}

{[}The volume of a cone of base radius $r$ and height $h$ is given
by $V=\frac{1}{3}\pi r^{2}h$.{]}
