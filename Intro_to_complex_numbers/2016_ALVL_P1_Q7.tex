\begin{enumerate}
\item Verify that $-1+5i$ is a root of the equation $w^{2}+\left(-1-8i\right)w+\left(-17+17i\right)=0$.
Hence. or otherwise, find the second root of the equation in cartesian
form, $p+iq$, showing your working. \hfill{}{[}5{]}
\item The equation $z^{3}-5z^{2}+16z+k=0$, where $k$ is a real constant,
has a root $z=1+ai$, where $a$ is a positive real constant. Find
the values of $a$ and $k$, showing your working. \hfill{}{[}5{]}
