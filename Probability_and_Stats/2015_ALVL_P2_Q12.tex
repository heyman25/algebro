In this question you should state clearly the values of the parameters
of any normal distribution you use. 

The masses in grams of apples have the distribution $N\left(300,20^{2}\right)$
and the masses in grams of pears have the distribution $N\left(200,15^{2}\right)$.
A certain recipe requires 5 apples and 8 pears. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that the total mass of 5 randomly chosen apples
is more than I600 grams. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item Find the probability that the total mass of 5 randomly chosen apples
is more than the total mass of 8 randomly chosen pears. \hfill{}

\end{enumerate}
The recipe requires the apples and pears to be prepared by peeling
them and removing the cores. This process reduces the mass of each
apple by 15\% and the mass of each pear by 10\%. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that the total mass, after preparation, of 5
randomly chosen apples and 8 randomly chosen pears is less than 2750
grams. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\end{enumerate}
