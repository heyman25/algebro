Yan is carrying out an experiment with a fair 6-sided die and a biased
6-sided die, each numbered front 1 to 6.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Yan rolls the fair die 10 times. Find the probability that it shows
a 6 exactly 3 times. \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\item Yan now rolls the fair die 60 times. Use a suitable approximate distribution,
which should be stated, to find the probability that the die shows
a 6 between 5 and 8 times, inclusive. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\end{enumerate}
The probability that the biased die shows a 6 is $\frac{1}{15}$.
