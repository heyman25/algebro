A bag contains 6 red counters and 3 yellow counters. In a game, Lee
removes counters at random from the bag. one at a time, until he has
taken out 2 red counters. The total number of counters Lee removes
from the bag is denoted by $T$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find $P\left(T=t\right)$ for all possible values of $t$. \hfill{}{[}3{]} 
\item Find $E\left(T\right)$ and $Var\left(T\right)$.\hfill{} {[}2{]} 
\end{enumerate}
Lee plays this game 15 times. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that Lee has to take at least 4 counters out
of the bag in at least 5 of his 15 games.\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
