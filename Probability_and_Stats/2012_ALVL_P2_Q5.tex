The probability that a hospital patient has a particular disease is
0.001. A test for the disease has probability $p$ of giving a positive
result when the patient has the disease, and equal probability $p$
of giving a negative result when the patient does not have the disease.
A patient is given the test.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given that $p=0.995$. find the probability that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item the result of the test is positive. {[}2{]} 
\item the patient has the disease given that the result of the test is positive.
{[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
\item it is given instead that there is a probability of 0.75 that the patient
has the disease given that the result of the test is positive. Find
the value of $p$, giving your answer correct to 6 decimal places.
