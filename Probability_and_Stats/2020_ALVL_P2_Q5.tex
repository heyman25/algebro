Shania and Tina are playing a game. Shania has a bag containing one
green disc, $r$ red discs and $2r$ blue discs, where $r>1$. A red
disc is worth 5 points. a blue disc is worth 2 points and the green
disc is worth 0 points. Tina takes two discs from the bag at random.
Tina's score is found by multiplying together the number of points
for each of the two discs she takes. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item State Tina\textquoteright s possible scores. \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\item Show that the expectation of Tina's score is $\frac{27r-11}{3r+1}$.
and find an expression for the variance.\hfill{} {[}7{]}
\item Given that the variance of Tina's score is 38, find the value of $r$.
