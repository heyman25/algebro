A machine is used to generate codes consisting of three letters followed
by two digits. Each of the three letters generated is equally likely
to be any of the twenty-six letters of the alphabet A-Z. Each of the
two digits generated is equally likely to be any of the nine digits
1-9. The digit 0 is not used. Find the probability that a randomly
chosen code has 
\begin{enumerate}
\item three different letters and two different digits. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item the second digit higher than the first digit. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item exactly two letters the same or two digits the same, but not both.
\hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item exactly one vowel (A, E, I, O or U) and exactly one even digit. \hfill{}
{[}4{]}
\end{enumerate}
