A small component for a machine is made from two metal spheres joined
by a short metal bar. The masses in grams of the spheres have the
distribution $N\left(20.0.5^{2}\right)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that the mass of a randomly selected sphere is
more than 20.2 grams.\hfill{} {[}1{]}
\end{enumerate}
In order to protect them from rusting. the spheres are given a coating
which increases the mass of each sphere by 10\%.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that the mass of a coated sphere is between 21.5
and 22.45 grams. State the distribution you use and its parameters.
\hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item The masses of the metal bars are normally distributed such that 60\%
of them have a mass greater than 12.2 grams and 25\% of them have
a mass less than 12 grams. Find the mean and standard deviation of
the masses of metal bars. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item The probability that the total mass of a component, consisting of
two randomly chosen coated spheres and one randomly chosen bar, is
more than $k$ grams is 0.75. Find $k$, stating the parameters of
any distribution you use. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
