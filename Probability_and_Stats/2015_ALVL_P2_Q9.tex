For events $A$, $B$ and $C$ it is given that $P\left(A\right)=0.45$,
$P\left(B\right)=0.4$, $P\left(C\right)=0.3$ and $P\left(A\cap B\cap C\right)=0.1$.
It is also given that events $A$ and $B$ are independent, and that
events $A$ and $C$ are independent.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find $P\left(B\mid A\right)$. \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\item Given also that events $B$ and $C$ are independent, find $P\left(A'\cap B'\cap C'\right)$.
\hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item Given instead that events $B$ and $C$ are \textbf{not} independent,
find the greatest and least possible values of $P\left(A'\cap B'\cap C'\right)$.
