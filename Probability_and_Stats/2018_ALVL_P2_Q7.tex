The events $A$, $B$ and $C$ are such that $P\left(A\right)=a$,
$P\left(B\right)=b$ and $P\left(C\right)=c$. $A$ and $B$ are independent
events. $A$ and $C$ are mutually exclusive events. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find an expression for $P\left(A'\cap B'\right)$ and hence prove
that $A'$ and $B'$ are independent events. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item Find an expression for $P\left(A'\cap C'\right)$. Draw a Venn diagram
to illustrate the case when $A'$ and $C'$ are also mutually exclusive
events. (You should not show event $B$ on your diagram.) \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
You are now given that $A'$ and $C'$ are \textbf{not} mutually exclusive,
$P\left(A\right)=\frac{2}{5}$, $P\left(B\cap C\right)=\frac{1}{5}$
and $P\left(A'\cap B'\cap C'\right)=\frac{1}{10}$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find exactly the maximum and minimum possible values of $P\left(A\cap B\right)$.
