\begin{enumerate}
\item The random variable $X$ has distribution $N\left(15,a^{2}\right)$
and $P\left(10<X<20\right)=0.5$. Find the value of $a$. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item The random variable $Y$ has distribution $B\left(4,p\right)$ and
$P\left(Y=1\right)+P\left(Y=2\right)=0.5$. Show that $4p^{4}-12p^{2}+8p=1$
and hence find the possible values of $p$. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item On a television quiz show contestants have to select the right answer
from one of three alternatives. George decides to do this entirely
by guesswork. Use a suitable approximation, which should be stated,
to find the probability that George guesses at least 30 questions
right out of 100. \hfill{} {[}4{]}
