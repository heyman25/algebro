In this question you should state the parameters of any normal distributions
you use.

A company makes 3-legged wooden stools from 4 solid components - a
seat in the form of a disc, and 3 legs each in the form of a long.
thin cylinder. The seats and legs are bought in bulk from another
company. Over a period oftime it is found that the masses of the seats
are normally distributed; 80\% of the seats have mass less titan 2.1
kg, and 15\% of the seats have mass less than 1.95 kg.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the mean mass of the seats and show that the standard deviation
is 0.0799 kg, correct to 3 significant figures. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\end{enumerate}
The masses of the legs, in kg, follow the distribution $N\left(1.2,0.02^{2}\right)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(b)]  Find the expected number of legs with mass more than 1.21 kg in
a randomly chosen batch of 500 legs. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item[(c)]  Find the probability that the total mass of a randomly chosen seat
and 3 randomly chosen legs is between 5.6 kg and 5.7 kg. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\end{enumerate}
