In a game, a computer randomly chooses 12 shapes from ll circles and
I7 rectangles. The number of rectangles chosen is denoted by $R$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $P\left(R=1\right)<P\left(R=2\right)$. \hfill{}{[}7{]}
\end{enumerate}
The number of rectangles available is now increased by r. The computer
randomly chooses 12 shapes from the 11 circles and $\left(17+r\right)$
rectangles. The probability that 4 rectangles are chosen is now 15
times the probability that 3 rectangles are chosen.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the value of $r$. \hfill{}{[}5{]}
\end{enumerate}
