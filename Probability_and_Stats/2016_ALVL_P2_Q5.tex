In a game of chance, a player has to spin a fair spinner. The spinner
has 7 sections and an arrow which has an equal chance of coming to
rest over any of the 7 sections. The spinner has 1 section labelled
\textbf{R}, 2 sections labelled \textbf{B} and 4 sections labelled
\textbf{Y} (see diagram). 

The player then has to throw one of three fair six-sided dice. coloured
red, blue or yellow. If the spinner comes to rest over \textbf{R}
the red die is thrown, if the spinner comes to rest over \textbf{B}
the blue die is thrown and if the spinner comes to rest over \textbf{Y}
the yellow die is thrown. The yellow die has one face with $\ast$
on it, the blue die has two faces with $\ast$ on it and the red die
has three faces with $\ast$ on it. The player wins the game if the
die thrown comes to rest with a face showing $\ast$ uppermost.
