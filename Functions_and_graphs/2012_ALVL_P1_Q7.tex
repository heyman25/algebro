A function $f$ is said to be self-inverse if $f\left(x\right)=f^{-1}\left(x\right)$
for all $x$ in the domain of $f$. 

The function $g$ is defined by 
\[
g:x\mapsto\frac{x+k}{x-1},\,x\in\mathbb{R},\,x\ne1,
\]
 where $k$ is a constant, $k\neq-1$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $g$ is self-inverse. \hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item Given that $k>0$, sketch the curve $y=g\left(x\right)$, stating
the equations of any asymptotes and the coordinates of any points
where the curve crosses the $x$- and $y$-axes. \hfill{} {[}3{]}
\item State the equation of one line of symmetry of the curve in part (ii),
and describe fully a sequence of transformations which would transform
the curve $y=\frac{1}{x}$ onto this curve. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\end{enumerate}
