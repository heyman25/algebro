A curve $C$ has equation $y=\frac{4x+9}{x+2}$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that the gradient of $C$ is negative for all points on $C$.\hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item By expressing the equation of $C$ in the form $y=a+\frac{b}{x+2}$,
where $a$ and $b$ are constants, wnte down the equations of the
asymptotes of $C$.\hfill{} {[}3{]}
\item Describe a pair of transformations which transforms the graph of $C$
on to the graph of $y=\frac{1}{x}$.\hfill{}{[}2{]}
