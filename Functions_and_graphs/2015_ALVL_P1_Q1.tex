A curve $C$ has equation 
\[
y=\frac{a}{x^{2}}+bx+c,
\]
where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants. It is given that $C$ passes
through the points with coordinates $\left(1.6,-2.4\right)$ and $\left(-0.7,3.6\right)$,
and that the gradient of $C$ is 2 at the point where $x=1$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the values of $a$, $b$ and $c$, giving your answers correct
to 3 decimal places.\hfill{} {[}4{]}
\item Find the $x$-coordinate of the point where $C$ crosses the $x$-axis,
giving your answer correct to 3 decimal places. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item One asymptote of $C$ is the line with equation $x=0$. Write down
the equation of the other asymptote of $C$. \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\end{enumerate}
