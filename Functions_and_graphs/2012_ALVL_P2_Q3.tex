It is given that $f\left(x\right)=x^{3}+x^{2}-2x-4$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sketch the graph of $y=f\left(x\right)$. {[}1{]} 
\item Find the integer solution of the equation $f\left(x\right)=4$, and
prove algebraically that there are no other real solutions. {[}3{]} 
\item State the integer solution of the equation $\left(x+3\right)^{3}+\left(x+3\right)^{2}-2\left(x+3\right)-4=4$.
{[}1{]} 
\item Sketch the graph of $y=\left|f\left(x\right)\right|$. {[}1{]} 
\item Write down two different cubic equations which between them give the
roots of the equation $\left|f\left(x\right)\right|=4$. Hence find
all the roots of this equation. {[}4{]}
