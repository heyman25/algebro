A bag contains $\left(n+5\right)$ numbered balls. Two of the balls
are numbered 3, three of the balls are numbered 4 and $n$ of the
balls are numbered 5. Two balls are taken, at random and without replacement.
from the bag. The random variable $S$ is the sum of the numbers on
the two balls taken.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the probability distribution of $S$. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item For the case where $n=1$, find $P\left(S=10\right)$ and explain
this result.\hfill{} {[}1{]}
\item Show that $E\left(S\right)=\frac{10n+36}{n+5}$ and $Var\left(S\right)=\frac{g\left(n\right)}{\left(n+5\right)^{2}\left(n+4\right)}$
where $g\left(n\right)$ is a quadratic polynomial to be determined.\hfill{}
