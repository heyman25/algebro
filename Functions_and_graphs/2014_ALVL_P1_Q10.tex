The mass, $x$ grams, of a certain substance present in a chemical
reaction at time $t$ minutes satisfies the differential equation 

\[
\frac{dx}{dt}=k\left(1+x-x^{2}\right),
\]
 

where $0\leq x\leq\frac{1}{2}$ and $k$ is a constant. It is given
that $x=\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{dx}{dt}=-\frac{1}{4}$, when $t=0$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $k=-\frac{1}{5}$. \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\item By first expressing $1+x-x^{2}$ in completed square form, find $t$
in terms of $x$. \hfill{}{[}5{]}
\item Hence find 
\begin{enumerate}
\item the exact time taken for the mass of the substance present in the
chemical reaction to become half of its initial value, \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\item the time taken for there to be none of the substance present in the
chemical reaction, giving your answer correct to 3 decimal places.
\hfill{}{[}1{]}
\end{enumerate}
\item Express the solution of the differential equation in the form $x=f\left(t\right)$
and sketch the part of the curve with this equation which is relevant
in this context.\hfill{} {[}5{]}
\end{enumerate}
