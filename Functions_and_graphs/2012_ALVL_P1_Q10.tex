and volume $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}$.{]} 

A model of a concert hall is made up of three parts. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The roof is modelled by the curved surface of a hemisphere of radius
$r$ cm. 
\item The walls are modelled by the curved surface of a cylinder of radius
$r$ cm and height $h$ cm. 
\item The floor is modelled by a circular disc of radius $r$ cm. 
\end{itemize}
The three parts are joined together as shown in the diagram. The model
is made of material of negligible thickness. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item It is given that the volume of the model is a fixed value $k$ cm$^{3}$,
and the external surface area is a minimum. Use differentiation to
find the values of $r$ and $h$ in terms of $k$. Simplify your answers.
\hfill{} {[}7{]}
\item It is given instead that the volume of the model is 200 cm$^{3}$
and its external surface area is 180 cm$^{2}$. Show that there are
two possible values of $r$. Given also that $r<h$, find the value
of $r$ and the value of $h$. \hfill{}{[}5{]}
