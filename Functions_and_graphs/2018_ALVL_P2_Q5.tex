The manufacturer of a certain type of fan used for cooling electronic
devices claims that the mean time to failure (MTTF) is 65 000 hours.
The quality control manager suspects that the MTTF is actually less
than 65 000 hours and decides to carry out a hypothesis test on a
sample of these fans. (An accelerated testing procedure is used to
find the MTTF.)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain why the manager should take a sample of at least 30 fans,
and state how these fans should be chosen.\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item State suitable hypotheses for the test, defining any symbols that
you use. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
The quality control manager takes a suitable sample of 43 fans, and
finds that they have an MTTF of 64 230 hours.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given that the manager concludes that there is no reason to reject
the null hypothesis at the 5\% level of significance, find the range
of possible values of the variance used in calculating the test statistic.
