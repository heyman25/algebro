\begin{enumerate}
\item Sketch a scatter diagram that might be expected when $x$ and $y$
are related approximately by $y=px^{2}+t$ in each of the cases (i)
and (ii) below. In each case your diagram should include 6 points,
approximately equally spaced with respect to $x$, and with all $x$-values
positive. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $p$ and $t$ are both positive. 
\item $p$ is negative and $t$ is positive. {[}2{]}

\item The ages in months ($m$) and prices in dollars ($P$) of a random
sample of ten used cars of a certain model are given in the table.

$m$ & 11 & 20 & 28 & 36 & 40 & 47 & 58 & 62 & 68 & 75\tabularnewline

$P$ & 112 800 & 102 600 & 76 500 & 72 000 & 72 000 & 69 000 & 65 800 & 57 000 & 50 600 & 47 600\tabularnewline

It is thought that the price after m months can be modelled by one
of the formulae 
\[
P=am+b,\,P=c\ln m+d,
\]
. where $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are constants. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find, correct to 4 decimal places. the value of the product moment
correlation coefficient between 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $m$ and $P$, 
\item $\ln m$ and $P$. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
\item Explain which of $P=am+b$ and $P=c\ln m+d$ is the better model and
find the equation of a suitable regression line for this model. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item Use the equation of your regression line to estimate the price of
a car that is 50 months old. \hfill{}{[}1{]}
