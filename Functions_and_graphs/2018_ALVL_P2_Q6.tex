In a computer game, a bug moves from left to right through a network
of connected paths. The bug starts at $S$ and, at each junction,
randomly takes the left fork with probability $p$ or the right fork
with probability $q$, where $q=1-p$. The forks taken at each junction
are independent. The bug finishes its journey at one of the 9 endpoints
labelled A-I (see diagram). 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that the probability that the bug finishes its journey at $D$
is $56p^{5}q^{3}$.\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item Given that the probability that the bug finishes its joumey at $D$
is greater than the probability that the bug finishes its joumey at
any one of the other endpoints, find exactly the possible range of
values of $p$. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\end{enumerate}
In another version of the game, the probability that, at each junction,
the bug takes the left fork is $0.9p$, the probability that the bug
takes the right fork is $0.9q$ and the probability that the bug is
swallowed up by a 'black hole\textquoteright{} is 0.1. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that, in this version of the game, the bug reaches
one of the endpoints A-I, without being swallowed up by a black hole.
