The diagram shows the curve $f\left(x\right)$. The curve crosses
the $x$-axis at the points $A$, $B$ and $C$, and has a maximum
turning point at $D$ where it crosses the $y$-axis. The coordinates
of $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ are $\left(-a,0\right)$, $\left(b,0\right)$,
$\left(c,0\right)$ and $\left(0,d\right)$ respectively, where $a$,
$b$, $c$ and $d$ are positive constants.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sketch the curve $y^{2}=f\left(x\right)$, stating, in terms of $a$,
$b$, $c$ and $d$, the coordinates of any turning points and of
the points where the curve crosses the $x$-axis.\hfill{} {[}4{]}
\item What can be said about the tangents to the curve $y^{2}=f\left(x\right)$
at the points where it crosses the $x$-axis?\hfill{} {[}1{]}
\end{enumerate}
