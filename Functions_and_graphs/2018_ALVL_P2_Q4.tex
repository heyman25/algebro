In this question you may use expansions from the List of Formulae
(MF26). 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the Maclaurin expansion of $\ln\left(\cos2x\right)$ in ascending
powers of $x$, up to and including the term in $x^{6}$. State any
value(s) of $x$ in the domain $0\le x\leq\frac{1}{4}\pi$ for which
the expansion is \textbf{not} valid.\hfill{} {[}6{]}
\item Use your expansion from part (i) and integration to find an approximate
expression for $\int\frac{\ln\left(\cos2x\right)}{x^{2}}\,dx$. Hence
find an approximate value for $\int_{0}^{0.5}\frac{\ln\left(\cos2x\right)}{x^{2}}\,dx$,
giving your answer to 4 decimal places.\hfill{} {[}3{]}
\item Use your graphing calculator to find a second approxrmate value for
$\int_{0}^{0.5}\frac{\ln\left(\cos2x\right)}{x^{2}}\,dx$, giving
your answer to 4 decimal places. \hfill{}{[}1{]}
