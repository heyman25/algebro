{[}It is given that the volume of a sphere of radius $r$ is $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}$
and that the volume of a circular cone with base radius $r$ and height
$h$ is $\frac{1}{3}\pi r^{2}h$.{]} .

A toy manufacturer makes a toy which consists of a hemisphere of radius
rcm joined to a circular cone of base radius $r$ cm and height $h$
cm (see diagram). The manufacturer determines that the length of the
slant edge of the cone must be 4cm and that the total volume of the
toy, $V\text{cm}^{3}$, should be as large as possible. 

Find a formula for $V$ in terms of $r$. Given that $r=r_{1}$ is
the value of $r$ which gives the maximum value of $V$, show that
$r_{1}$ satisfies the equation $45r^{4}-768r^{2}+1024=0$.\hfill{}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the two solutions to the equation in part (i) for which $r>0$,
giving your answers correct to 3 decimal places. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item Show that one of the solutions found in part (ii) does not give a
stationary value of $V$. Hence write down the value of $r_{1}$ and
find the corresponding value of $h$. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item Sketch the graph showing the volume of the toy as the radius of the
hemisphere varies. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
