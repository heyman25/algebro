\item A flat novelty plate for serving food on is made in the shape of the
region enclosed by the curve $y=x^{2}-6x+5$ and the line $2y=x-1$.
Find the area of the plate. \hfill{}{[}4{]} 
\item A curved container has a flat circular top. The shape of the container
is formed by rotating the part of the curve $x=\frac{\sqrt{y}}{a-y^{2}}$,
where $a$ is a constant greater than 1, between the points $\left(0,0\right)$
and $\left(\frac{1}{a-1},1\right)$. through $2\pi$ radians about
the $y$-axis. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the volume of the container, giving your answer as a single fraction
in terms of $a$ and $\pi$.\hfill{} {[}4{]} 
\item Another curved container with a flat circular top is formed in the
same way from the curve $x=\frac{\sqrt{y}}{b-y^{2}}$ and the points
$\left(0,0\right)$ and $\left(\frac{1}{b-1},1\right)$. It has a
volume that is four times as great as the container in part (i). Find
an expression for $b$ in terms of $a$. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
