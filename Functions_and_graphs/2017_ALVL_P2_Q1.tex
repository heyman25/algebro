A curve $C$ has parametric equations 
\[
x=\frac{3}{t},\,\,y=2t.
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item The line $y=2x$ cuts $C$ at the points $A$ ant $B$. Find the exact
length of $AB$. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item The tangent at the pornt $P\left(\frac{3}{p},2p\right)$ on $C$ meets
the $x$-axis at $D$ and the $y$-axis at $E$. The point $F$ is
the midpoint of $DE$. Find a cartesian equation of the curve traced
by $F$ as $p$ varies.\hfill{} {[}5{]}
\end{enumerate}
