\item A curve $C$ has parametric equations 
\[
x=3t^{2},\,y=6t.
\]
 
\item Find the value of $t$ at the point on $C$ where the tangent has
gradient 0.4. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item The tangent at the point $P\left(3p^{2},6p\right)$ on $C$ meets
the $y$-axis at the point $D$. Find the cartesian equation of the
locus of the mid-point of $PD$ as $p$ varies.\hfill{} {[}4{]}
