The curve $C$ is defined by the parametric equations
\[
x=3t^{2}+2,\,y=6t-1,\,\text{where }t\geq6.
\]
 The line $N$ is the normal to $C$ at the point $\left(14,11\right)$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the cartesian equation of $N$. Give your answer in the form
$ax+by=c$, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are integers to be determined.\hfill{}

\item Find the area enclosed by $C$, $N$ and the $x$-axis. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item The curve $C$ and the line $N$ are both transformed by a 2-way stretch,
scale factor 2 in the $x$-direction and scale factor 3 in the $y$-direction,
to fonn the curve $D$ and the line $M$.
