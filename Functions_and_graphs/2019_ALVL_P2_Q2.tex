The diagram shows a sketch of the curve $y=f\left(x\right)$. The
region under the curve between $x=1$ and $x=5$, shown shaded in
the diagram, is $A$. This region is split into 5 vertical strips
of equal width, $h$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item State the value of $h$ and show, using a sketch, that $\sum_{n=0}^{4}\left(f\left(1+nh\right)\right)h$
is less than the area of $A$. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item Find a similar expression that is greater than the area of $A$. \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\end{enumerate}
You are now given that $f\left(x\right)=\frac{1}{20}x^{2}+1$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the expression given in part (a) and your expression from part
(b) to find lower and upper bounds for the area of $A$. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item Sketch the graph of a function$y=g\left(x\right)$, between $x=1$
and $x=5$, for which the area between the curve, the $x$-axis and
the lines $x=1$ and $x=5$ is less than $\sum_{n=0}^{4}\left(g\left(1+nh\right)\right)h$.
