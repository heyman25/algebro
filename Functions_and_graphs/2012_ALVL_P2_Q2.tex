The complex number $z$ satisfies the equation $\left|z-(7-3i)\right|=4$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sketch an Argand diagram to illustrate this equation. {[}2{]}
\item Given that $\left|z\right|$ is as small as possible,
\begin{enumerate}
\item find the exact value of $\left|z\right|$. {[}2{]} 
\item hence find an exact expression for $z$, in the form $x+iy$. {[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
\item It is given instead that $-\pi<\arg z\le\pi$ and that $\left|\arg z\right|$
is as large as possible. Find the value of $\arg z$ in radians, correct
to 4 significant figures. {[}3{]}
\end{enumerate}
