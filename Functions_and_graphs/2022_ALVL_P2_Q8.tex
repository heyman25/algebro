\begin{enumerate}
\item The independent random variables $X$ and $Y$ are such that $X\sim N\left(p,q^{2}\right)$
and $Y\sim N\left(s,t^{2}\right)$. Write down an expression for the
distribution of the random variable $aX-bY$, where $a$ and $b$
are constants. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item The random variable $V$ is normally distributed with standard deviation
2. The probability that $V>8$ is equal to the probability that $V<4$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a sketch to show the distribution of $V$, including the main
features of the curve. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item On your sketch. shade the area represented by $P\left(V>10\right)$
and state its value. 
\end{enumerate}
\item The random variable $W$ is such that $W\sim B(8p)$. The mean of
$W$ is l.2 times the variance of $W$. Find $P\left(W<2\right)$.\hfill{}
