A curve $C$ has parametric equations 
\[
x=\theta-\sin\theta,\,y=1-\cos\theta,
\]
where $0\le\theta\le2\pi$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $\frac{dy}{dx}=\cot\frac{1}{2}\theta$ and find the gradient
of $C$ at the point where $\theta=\pi$. What can be said about the
tangents to $C$ as $\theta\rightarrow0$ and $\theta\rightarrow2\pi$?
\hfill{}{[}5{]}
\item Sketch $C$, showing clearly the features of the curve at the points
where $\theta=0$, $\pi$ and $2\pi$. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item Without using a calculator, find the exact area of the region bounded
by $C$ and the $x$-axis. \hfill{}{[}5{]}
\item A point $P$ on $C$ has parameter $p$, where $0<p<\frac{1}{2}\pi$.
Show that the normal to $C$ at $P$ crosses the $x$-axis at the
point with coordinates $\left(p,0\right)$. \hfill{} {[}3{]}
