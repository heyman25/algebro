The diagram shows a sketch of the curve $y=f(x)$. The region under
the curve between $x=1$ and $x=5$, shown shaded in the diagram,
is $A$. This region is split into 5 vertical strips of equal width,
$h$.
\noindent \begin{center}
<INSERT DIAGRAM HERE>
\par\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
\item State the value of $h$ and show, using a sketch, that $\sum_{n=0}^{4}\left(f\left(1+nh\right)\right)h$
is less than the area of $A$. \hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item Find a similar expression that is greater than the area of $A$. \hfill{}
{[}1{]}
\end{enumerate}
You are now given that $f(x)=\text{\ensuremath{\frac{1}{20}x^{2}+1}}$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(c)]  Use the expression given in part (a) and your expression from part
(b) to find lower and upper bounds for the area of A. \hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item Sketch the graph of a function $y=g(x)$, between $x=1$ and $x=5$,
for which the area between the 4 curve, the $x$-axis and the lines
$x=1$ and $x=5$ is less than $\sum_{n=0}^{4}(g(1+nh))h$. \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\end{enumerate}
