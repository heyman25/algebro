An electrical circuit comprises a power source of $V$ volts in series
with a resistance of $R$ ohms, a capacitance of $C$ farads and an
inductance of $L$ henries. The current in the circuit, $t$ seconds
after turning on the power, is $I$ amps and the charge on the capacitor
is $q$ coulombs. The circuit can be used by scientists to investigate
resonance, to model heavily damped motion and to tune into radio stations
on a stereo tuner. It is given that $R$, $C$ and $L$ are constants,
and that $I=0$ when $t=0$.

A differential equation for the circuit is $L\frac{dI}{dt}+RI+\frac{q}{C}=V$,
where $I=\frac{dq}{dt}$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that. under certain conditions on $V$ which should be stated,
\[
L\frac{d^{2}I}{dt^{2}}+R\frac{dI}{dt}+\frac{I}{C}=0.
\]

\end{enumerate}
It is now given that the differential equation in part (i) holds for
the rest of the question.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given that $I=Ate^{-\frac{Rt}{2L}}$ is a solution of the differential
equation, where $A$ is a positive constant. Show that $C=\frac{4L}{R^{2}}$.\hfill{}

\item In a particular circuit, $R=4$, $L=3$ and $C=0.75$. Find the maximum
value of $I$ in terms of $A$, showing that this value is a maximum.\hfill{}
