A curve $C$ has parametric equations 
\[
x=3t^{2},\,y=2t^{3}.
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the equation of the tangent to $C$ at the point with parameter
$t$. \hfill{} {[}3{]}
\item Points $P$ and $Q$ on $C$ have parameters $p$ and $q$ respectively.
The tangent at $P$ meets the tangent at $Q$ at the point $R$. Show
that the $x$-coordinate of $R$ is $p^{2}+pq+q^{2}$, and find the
$y$-coordinate of $R$ in terms of $p$ and $q$. Given that $pq=-1$,
show that $R$ lies on the curve with equation $x=y^{2}+1$. \hfill{}{[}5{]}

A curve $L$ has equation $x=y^{2}+1$. The diagram shows the parts
of $C$ and $L$ for which $y\geq0$. The curves $C$ and $L$ touch
at the point $M$. 
\item Show that $4t^{6}-3t^{2}+1=0$ at $M$. Hence, or otherwise, find
the exact coordinates of $M$. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item Find the exact value of the area of the shaded region bounded by $C$
and $L$ for which $y\geq0$. \hfill{}{[}6{]}
