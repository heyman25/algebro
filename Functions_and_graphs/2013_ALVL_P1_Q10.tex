The variables $x$, $y$ and $z$ are connected by the following differential
equations. 
\[
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\frac{dz}{dx} & = & 3-2z &  & \text{(A)}\\
\frac{dy}{dx} & = & z &  & \text{(B)}
\end{array}
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item Given that $z<\frac{3}{2}$, solve equation (A) to find $z$ in terms
of $x$. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item Hence find $y$ in terms of $x$. \hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item Use the result in part (ii) to show that 
\[
\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}=a\frac{dy}{dx}+b,
\]
for constants $a$ and $b$ to be determined. \hfill{} {[}3{]}
\item The result in part (ii) represents a family of curves: Some members
of the family are straight lines. Write down the equations of two
of these lines. On a single diagram, sketch one of your lines together
wrth a non-linear member of the family of curves that has your line
as an asymptote. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
