\item {[}ALVL/2019/P1/2{]}

The curve $C$ has equation $y=x^{3}+x-1$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $C$ crosses the $x$-axis at the point with coordinates $\left(a,0\right)$.
Find the value of $a$ correct to 3 decimal places.\hfill{} {[}1{]}
\item You are given that $b>a$. 

The region $P$ is bounded by $C$, the $x$-axis and the lines $x=-1$
and $x=0$. The region $Q$ is bounded by $C$, the line $x=b$ and
the part of the x-axis between $x=a$ and $x=b$. Given that the area
of $Q$ is 2 times the area of $P$, find the value of $b$ correct
to 3 decimal places.\hfill{}{[}4{]}
