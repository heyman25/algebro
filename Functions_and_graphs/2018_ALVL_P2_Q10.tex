In this question you should state the parameters of any distributions
that you use. 

A manufacturer produces specialist light bulbs. The masses in grams
of one type of light bulb have the normal distribution $N\left(50,1.5^{2}\right)$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sketch the distribution for masses between 40 grams and 60 grams.
\hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item Find the probability that the mass of a randomly chOSen bulb is less
than 50.4 grams. \hfill{}{[}1{]}
\end{enumerate}
Each light bulb is packed into a randomly chosen box. The masses of
the empty boxes have the distribution $N\left(75,2^{2}\right)$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that the total mass of 4 randomly chosen empty
boxes is more than 297 grams.\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item Find the probability that the total mass of a randomly chosen light
bulb and a randomly chosen box is between 124.9 and 125.7 grams.\hfill{}

\end{enumerate}
In order to protect the bulbs in transit each bulb is surrounded by
padding before being packed in a box. The mass of the padding is modelled
as 30\% of the mass of the bulb.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The probability that the total mass of a box containing a bulb and
padding is more than $k$ grams is 0.9. Find $k$. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\item Find the probability that the total mass of 4 randomly chosen boxes,
each containing a bulb and pudding, is more than 565 grams. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\end{enumerate}
