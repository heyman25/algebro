In this question you should assume that $T$, $W$ and $D$ follow
independent normal distributions. 

James leaves home to go to work at $T$ minutes past 8 am each day,
where $T$ follows the distribution $N\left(5,1.2^{2}\right)$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sketch this distribution for the period from 8 am to 8.10 am.\hfill{}
{[}2{]} 
\item Find the probability that, on a randomly chosen day, James leaves
for work later than 8.06 am. 
\end{enumerate}
When the weather is fine, James walks to work. The time, $W$ minutes,
he takes to walk to work follows the distribution $N(21,3^{2})$.
James is supposed to start work at 8.30 am. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that. on a randomly chosen day when James walks,
he is late for work. \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\end{enumerate}
When the weather is not fine, James drives to work. He still leaves
at $T$ minutes past 8 am each day; the time, $D$ minutes, he takes
to drive to work follows the distribution $N(19,6^{2})$. On average.
the weather is fine on 70\% of momings. 

(iv) One day, James is late for work. Find the probability that the
weather is fine that day. \hfill{}{[}5{]}
