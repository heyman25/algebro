A children\textquoteright s game is played with 20 cards, consisting
of 5 sets of 4 cards. Each set consists of a father, mother, daughter
and son from the same family. The family names are Red, Blue, Green,
Yellow and Orange. So, for example, the Red family cards are father
Red, mother Red, daughter Red and son Red. 

The 20 cards are arranged in a row. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item In how many different ways can the 20 cards be arranged so that the
4 cards in each family set are next to each other? \hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item In how many different ways can the cards be arranged so that all five
father cards are next to each other, all four Red family cards are
next to each other and all four Blue family cards are next to each
other? \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\end{enumerate}
The cards are now arranged at random in a circle. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that no two father cards are next to each other.
