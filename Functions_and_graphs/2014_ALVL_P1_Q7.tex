It is given that $f\left(x\right)=x^{6}-3x^{4}-7$. The diagram shows
the curve with equation $y=f\left(x\right)$ and the line with equation
$y=-7$ for $x\geq0$. The curve crosses the positive $x$-axis at
$x=\alpha$, and the curve and the line meet where $x=0$ and $x=\beta$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the value of $\alpha$, giving your answer correct to 3 decimal
places, and find the exact value of $\beta$.\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item Evaluate $\int_{\beta}^{\alpha}f\left(x\right)\,dx$, giving your
answer correct to 3 decimal places.\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item Find, in terms of $\sqrt{3}$, the area of the finite region bounded
by the curve and the line, for $x\geq0$. \hfill{}{[}3{]}
\item Show that $f\left(x\right)=f\left(-x\right)$. What can be said about
the six roots of the equation $f\left(x\right)=0$? \hfill{}{[}4{]}
\end{enumerate}
