Civil engineers design bridges to span over expressways. The diagram
below represents a bridge over an expressway, $PS$. 
\noindent \begin{center}
<INSERT DIAGRAM HERE>
\par\end{center}

In the diagram, $PQ$ and $SR$ are parallel to the $y$-axis, and
$PQ=SR$. The arch of the bridge, $QR$, forms part of the curve $OQRC$
with parametric equations 
\[
x=a\left(\theta-\sin\theta\right),\,y=a\left(1-\cos\theta\right),\,\text{for}\,0\leq\theta\leq2\pi.
\]

where $a$ is a positive constant. The units of $x$ and $y$ are
metres. 

At the point $Q$, $\theta=\beta$ and at the point $R$, $\theta=2\pi-\beta$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find, in terms of $a$ and $\beta$, the distance $PS$.\hfill{}{[}2{]}
\item Show that the area of the shaded region on the diagram, representing
the area under the bridge, is 
\[
\frac{1}{2}a^{2}\left(6\pi-6\beta+8\sin\beta-\sin2\beta\right).
\]
\hfill{} {[}6{]}
\item It is given that the area under the bridge, in square metres, is $7.8159a^{2}$.
Find the value of $\beta$. \hfill{}{[}l{]}
\item The width of the expressway, $PS$, is 50 metres. Find the greatest
and least heights of the arch, $QR$, above the expressway. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
