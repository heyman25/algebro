A curve $C$ has parametric equations 
\[
x=2\theta-\sin2\theta,y=2\sin^{2}\theta,
\]
for $0\leq\theta\leq\pi$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $\frac{dy}{dx}=\cot\theta$.\hfill{} {[}4{]}
\item The normal to the curve at the point where $\theta=\alpha$ meets
the $x$-axis at the point $A$. Show that the $x$-coordinate of
$A$ is $k\alpha$, where $k$ is a constant to be found.\hfill{}

The distance between two points along a curve is the arcvlength. Scientists
and engineers need to use arc-length in applications such as finding
the work done in moving an object along the path described by a curve
or the length of cabling used on a suspension bridge. 

The arc-length between two points on $C$, where $\theta=\beta$ and
$\theta=\gamma$, is given by the formula 
\[
\int_{\beta}^{\gamma}\sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{d\theta}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{dy}{d\theta}\right)^{2}}\,d\theta.
\]
Find the total length of $C$.\hfill{} {[}5{]}
\end{enumerate}
