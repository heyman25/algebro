Fig. 1 shows the net of a square-based pyramid cut from a square of
cardboard of side length 30 cm. The net consists of a square of side
length $a$ cm and four isosceles triangles, each with base $a$ cm
and perpendicular height $h$ cm. The net is folded to form a pyramid
which has a square base of side length $a$ cm and vertical height
$H$ cm, as shown in Fig. 2. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $H^{2}=225-15a$.\hfill{} {[}2{]}
\item Find the maximum possible volume of the pyramid. You do not need to
show that this value is a maximum.\hfill{} {[}5{]}

{[}The volume of a square-based pyramid is $\frac{1}{3}\times\text{base area}\times\text{height}${]}
\item {}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the value of $a$ for which the total surface area of the four
triangular faces of the pyramid is a maximum. You do not need to show
that this value is a maximum.\hfill{} {[}3{]}
\item Describe the shape formed from the net in this case.\hfill{} {[}1{]}
\end{enumerate}
