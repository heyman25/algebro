A cinema sells tickets at three different prices, depending on the
age of the customer. The age categories are under 16 years. between
16 and 65 years, and over 65 years. Three groups of people, $A$,
$B$ and $C$, go to the cinema on the same day. The numbers in each
age category for each group. together with the total cost of the tickets
for each group. are given in the following table. 
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
Group & Under 16 years & Between 16 and 65 years & Over 65 years & Total cost\tabularnewline
\hline 
$A$ & 9 & 6 & 4 & \$162.03\tabularnewline
\hline 
$B$ & 7 & 5 & 3 & \$128.36\tabularnewline
\hline 
$C$ & 10 & 4 & 6 & \$158.50\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}

Write down and solve equations to find the cost ofa ticket for each
of the age categories. \hfill{}{[}4{]}
