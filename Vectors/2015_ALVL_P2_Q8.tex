A market stall sells pineapples which have masses that are normally
distributed. The stall owner claims that the mean mass of the pineapples
is at least 0.9 kg. Nur buys a random selection of 8 pineapples from
the stall. The 8 pineapples have masses, in kg, as follows. 
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccccccc}
0.80 & 1.00 & 0.82  & 0.85 & 0.93 & 0.96 & 0.81 & 0.89 \tabularnewline
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}

Find unbiased estimates of the population mean and variance of the
mass of pineapples. Test at the 10\% level of significance whether
there is any evidence to doubt the stall owner\textquoteright s claim.
