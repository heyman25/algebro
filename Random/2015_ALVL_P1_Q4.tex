A piece of wire of fixed length $d$ m is cut into two parts. One
part is bent into the shape of a rectangle with sides of length $x$
m and $y$ m. The other part is bent into the shape of a semicircle,
including its diameter. The radius of the semicircle is $x$ m. Show
that the maximum value of the total area of the two shapes can be
expressed as $kd^{2}$~$\mathrm{m}^{2}$, where $k$ is a constant
to be found. {[}6{]}
